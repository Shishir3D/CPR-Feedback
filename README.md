**This is code for CPR feedback device.**

Components Needed for it are:
1) Arduino
2) Ultrasonic Sensor
3) Batteries
4) Bluetooth Module
5) Mannequin
6) Big Plastic bottle/jar that can retract easily after being contracted

The ultrasonic sensor and arduino the distance between the wall of the plastic jar and itself.
It then transmits that information using bluetooth module to the laptop.
Now, the data is converted into real time updating graph in the Excel Spreadsheet.

*Note: You will need to install data streamer plugin in excel to communicate to the arduino from the Excel.*
